# Rick and morty with web components  
 
I'm testing the web components standard through the Rick and Morty API. I also made a webpack template in order to:  
- Use Typescript.
- Write the components' styles in their own CSS file.
- Use SASS.

## Tech stack
- HTML
- CSS
- SASS
- Typescript

## How to run it locally

`$ npm install`  
`$ npm start`

## Production build

`$ npm run build`
